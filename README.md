# Deep-Q-Network-implementation
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an AI agent to play Atari's Breakout game. The implementation leverages OpenAI Gym for the game environment and TensorFlow/Keras for the neural network. Features include experience replay, target networks, and game monitoring via exported videos.
